## Want to just Play? Here you go!
Visit GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/Twinkllle/PokerMultiplayer/releases) and download version for your OS. For nowadays we have only **Windows** and **Linux** standalone client and dedicated server support.

## Standalone Setup Guide 
### [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network) IP and Port connection:
By default the input fields will be autocomplete depending on your **Local IP address**.
**Port** will be set to default **47924**.
![IpPortInputFields](GitImages/ipAndPortIF.png)
After setup of the connection data you will be allowed to start Hosting or Joining lobby
### [WAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network) IP and Port connection:
If you and your friends are not connected to the same **LAN** but still want to play together without resorting to services like **Hamachi** or **Radmin VPN** there is some solutions.
1. [**Unity Game Services:**](https://unity.com/solutions/gaming-services) To use it in SnaP game you should press *Create* button (that would be same as *Host* in LAN connection).
 
 ![RelayButtons](GitImages/RelayButtons.png) After that you will start hosting at Unity Realy servers. At the **Desk** in the bottom-left corner you will able to see your 6-digits **Join Code** (e.g. *ZXCQWE*) then you can left-click it. 
 This will copy code to the clipboard so you can send it to your friends so they should paste it to *Join Code* input filed. Then press Relay *Join* button.</br>

1. **Hosting with Port Forwarding:** First you have to forward a port (it can be default port *47924* or almost any other port you wish) in **Router/Firewall** settings (may be this [windows instruction](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-port-forward-4163829) can be helpful).
	Next steps:
	* Start game as you do it for LAN. 
	* Get your [Public IP address](https://www.whatismyip.com/).
	* Your friends should paste it at *IP* and forwarded *Port* to input fields and click *Join* button.
## Dedicated server Setup Guide
1. As in 2nd paragraph of WAN [Standalone Setup Guide](#wan-ip-and-port-connection) you have to forward a port.
2. When your port is forwarded you should start server.
* At Windows machine at `..\win_dedicated` run:
```bash
$ .\SnaP_Server.exe
```
* At Lunix machine run at `../linux_dedicated`  run:
```bash
$ sudo chmod +x ./SnaP_Server.x86_64
$ ./SnaP_Server.x86_64
```
If you forwarded different from *47924* port then you can add the `-port` argument when starting game.
```bash
$ ./SnaP_Server.x86_64 -port 12345
```

You will notified about the successful start of the server:
```bash 
=============================================================
STARTING AT: 192.168.0.69:12345
=============================================================
Forwarding to public IP...
# ...Some...
# ...Unity...

```
Or about start failure:
```bash
